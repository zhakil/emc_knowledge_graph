"""
Integration tests for the EMC Knowledge Graph pipeline.

These tests are intended to verify the end-to-end processing of documents,
from file input through to graph construction in a test Neo4j database.

NOTE: These tests are currently conceptual outlines.
      They require a fully functional Neo4jEMCService and a mechanism
      to set up/tear down a test Neo4j database instance (e.g., using Docker
      testcontainers, or a dedicated test DB). The `neo4j_emc_service.py`
      implementation is currently blocked by tool issues, so these tests
      cannot be fully implemented or run yet.
